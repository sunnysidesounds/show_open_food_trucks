# SHOW OPEN FOOD TRUCKS
Simple command-line program that will print out a list of food trucks, given a source of food truck data from the
San Francisco governmentâ€™s API.

## Setup & Install Dependencies For Program
1. Install virtualenv using `pip install virtualenv`
2. Pull down from git or unzip the show_open_food_trucks/ service source code.
3. Get to the root directory of the service `cd /path-to-project/show_open_food_trucks/`
4. Create a new virtual environment `virtualenv venv`
5. Active the new virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Install requirements into virtual environment `venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running Program
1. Run the program by `venv/bin/python show_open_food_trucks.py` or `python show_open_food_trucks.py`
- If there are more than 1 page. you will be prompted to enter a page number to view additional results

## Assumptions / Additional Details:
- Using the ***applicant*** key/value response to sort by alphabetically
- Using the ***start24*** and ***end24*** key/value response to determine if a food truck is open
- As it displays NAME and ADDRESS, I added HOURS that show what hours the food truck is open
- Using python module ***tabulate*** to format the output for the command-line


## Roadmap: (proof-of-concept to fully featured web application)
To turn this proof-of-concept command-line program to a fully featured web application

## Self-Evalution Code Review  (area's of improvment)
